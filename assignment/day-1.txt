1. create an application
	a. create a ctor func, which will help you to create 'developer' objects with following attributes: 
	i. value attributes: name, id, basicpay, dapay, hrapay, incentivepay, totalsalary (do not pass total salary to the function as argument, because this will be calcuated in the calculateSalary method)
	ii. functional attribute: calculateSalary
		args: NONE
		return type: void
		logic: just add those salary attributes, calculate and assign it to the totalSalary attribute

	create a ctor func, which will help you to create 'hr' objects with following attributes: 
	i. value attributes: name, id, basicpay, dapay, hrapay, gratuitypay, totalsalary (do not pass total salary to the function as argument, because this will be calcuated in the calculateSalary method)
	ii. functional attribute: calculateSalary
		args: NONE
		return type: void
		logic: just add those salary attributes, calculate and assign it to the totalSalary attribute

	b. create at least 2/3 object (using hard coded values)
	c. create an array to store those objects

	d. iterate through the array, pick up an object at a time and calculate the salary
	e. iterate through the array, display the the object's name and total salary
	f. filter the array to display only the developers with salary more than 10000
	g. sort the array by salary of the developers (highest to lowest)
	h. sort the developers in the array by the alphabetical order of their name
