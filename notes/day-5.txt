5. hooks

the appliaction will contain a dashboard, containing three buttons for navigation:
Home (to navigate to the home component)
Products (to navigate to the product list component)
Add Product (to navigate to the add product component)

http://localhost:3000/     ---> Home component
http://localhost:3000/home ---> Home 

http://localhost:3000/products ---> ProductList

when you click on any image in any row:
http://localhost:3000/product/{id} ---> ViewProduct (will fetch the id from the request and fetch the corresponding product detail and display the same. upon clicking the OK button on the component, user will be redirected to the product list)

when you click the name of product in any row
http://localhost:3000/product/update/{id} ---> UpdateProduct (will fetch the id from the request and fetch the corresponding product detail and display the same. after updating the values, click the submit buton and the record will be submitted after confirmation and user will be redirected to the product list component, where user can view the updated product in the table)

when you want to add a new product
http://localhost:3000/product/add ---> AddProduct (after add the values, click the submit buton and the record will be submitted after confirmation and user will be redirected to the product list component, where user can view the newly added product in the table)

anything else apart from the above mentioned routes, will result into page not found


Routing:
------------------------------------------
router engine: BrowserRouter, HashRouter, and MemoryRouter
	a. register your routes
	b. engine will look for route change in the browser, fetch the route, match with existing registered routes and accordingly display a component

route:
	define a route path
	mention which component will be dispplayed when the route is used

react-router and react-router-dom

HashRouter
http://.../#/products

BrowserRouter
HTML5
	pushState API

http://.../products
	history
	location
	match

MemoryRouter:
React Native
and React Testing


<Router>
        <Routes> 

	  <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
          <Route path='/home' element={<Home />} />
          <Route path='/products' element={<ProductList />} />
          <Route path='/product/:id' element={<ViewProduct />} />
          <Route path='/product/update/:id' element={<UpdateProduct />} />
          <Route path='/product/add' element={<AddProduct />} />
          <Route path='*' element={<PageNotFound />} />

	</Routes>
</Router>


React Hooks:
-----------------------------------
useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef, useMemo
useName()

useState (state hook)
useEffect (effect hook)
